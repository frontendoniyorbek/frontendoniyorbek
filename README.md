# üí´ About Me:
Doniyorbek Tursunov<br>Hello! My name is Doniyorbek, and I have been working in frontend development for the past 2 years. My main focus has been on the React.js framework.

I have been working at FindWork since 2023 and have been involved in creating various web applications during this time. In doing so, I have enhanced my skills in React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have experience in creating simple and effective interfaces.

Since the beginning of 2024, I have been working as a senior instructor at New Look Educational Center. With this opportunity, I aim to further improve my teaching skills in programming.
I am a creative, committed individual who is dedicated to creating useful web applications for hundreds of users. I keep a keen eye on the latest developments and am constantly striving to improve myself in the face of technological advancements.

While I enjoy writing code for projects, I am equally passionate about teaching students new technologies and supporting them in practical application.

If you are considering opportunities to participate in interesting development projects and contribute to the community, feel free to reach out to me. I value working with friends and colleagues, assessing my own time and resources, and gaining more knowledge.

I hope you'll find how my skills and experiences could be beneficial to your community. I would be happy to discuss additional information and collaboration opportunities.

Thank you!

Doniyorbek
